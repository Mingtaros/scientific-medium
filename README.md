## Why Should We Write?
Writing has always been a way to express one's thought, as where reading is the wondow of the world, writing can be said as the way to build the window. We can perceive our point of view and merge it to something others might feel and understand.
There are infinite reasons to write, just as much as there are infinite reason to speak our mind. The difference is that in writing, we also have to register what we have in our mind more than once instead of letting it slip through the way we talk. In one way or another, writing helps one thinks through problem by engaging both sides of the brain and conjures one's creativity while in an organized manner.
In a higher studies such as college, writing has been an essential skill to be possessed by students since it is an important work skill that shows how good someone is at communicating and showing what they got in mind. Facts state that writing is the best way of self reflection to help build another character that may grow under the influence of practice one chose to apply.
As an engineer, writing is still one of the best choice of communication especially in informatics engineering. Of course the main concern is often code writing, however any form of writing should be mastered to achieve some level of professionality.
