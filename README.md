## Why Writing Skill is Important
In my opinion, writing skill is important. There are three reason why writing is important.
- First, by writing, we can heighten our comprehension about certain topic or theory because writing means communicating our idea from abstract to real. The point is a piece of writing that can be understood by the others. It is obvious that to pour in our idea on a written thing, the writer needs an ability to communicate his idea into simple things that can be understood by others so they will understand what writers wanted to communicate. "If you can't explain it to a six years old, you don't understand it yourself" - Albert Einstein

- Second, by writing, the writer's vocabulary is expanded. To communicate some ideas, the writer needs to express it on writing things made from right use of word to make sure our idea is quite clear to readers. Use of word plays important part to prevent anything ambiguous things when readers read from their point of view. With the right use of word, any sentence or paragraph won't be mistaken to cause multiple interpretation. In other word, a sentence only has one meaning.

- Finally, by writing, all knowledge and experience that writer has achieved won't be forgetten because all those things are archived in a sheet full of writing. Written things such as an article or an essay can be one of many tools to keep the memories so that if someday writer forget what happen at certain time, writer can review what happens that time.
